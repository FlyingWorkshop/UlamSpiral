# UlamSpiral
A simple project that I coded up to visualize the [Ulam spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral). As a philosophical note, I think the prime spiral captures some of the magical essense of math. The fact that we can peer into the unknown and find beauty and meaning is a poetic truth and warning about humanity. Besides that, it's also just a really cool spiral.

Here's an example plot generated with n = 10000.
